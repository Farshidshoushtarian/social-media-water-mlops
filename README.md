## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an automated **MLOps pipeline** designed to help **water utilities** monitor and analyze public sentiment, service issues, and potential incidents by leveraging **social media data**.

🔹 Runs every **12 hours** to:
- Ingest posts from platforms like **Twitter/X**
- Perform **sentiment analysis**, **NER**, and **anomaly detection**
- Generate **GenAI-powered summaries**
- Trigger alerts and update a live dashboard

> 🎯 Built using modern MLOps practices, this project is also a portfolio piece demonstrating scalable, production-ready AI pipelines with **Hopsworks**, **GitHub Actions**, **Airflow**, and **Docker**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Automated social media scraping (Twitter/X)
- ✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- ✅ Centralized **Feature Store** using Hopsworks
- ✅ ML pipeline for Sentiment Analysis & Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- ✅ **GenAI summarization** (OpenAI API)
- ✅ Anomaly detection for complaint spikes
- ✅ Streamlit dashboard for real-time insights
- ✅ Alerts via email for critical issues
- ✅ CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Containerized with Docker
- ✅ Orchestrated with Airflow

🚧 Current Status
MVP in Progress
This project is under active development as a part-time initiative. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

📈 How It Works
Ingestion: Pulls relevant posts mentioning the utility every 12 hours.

Feature Layer: Processes text and stores structured data in Hopsworks.

Training Layer: ML models predict sentiment & extract entities.

Inference Layer: Generates summaries, detects anomalies, triggers alerts.

Visualization: Updates dashboard and sends reports.
